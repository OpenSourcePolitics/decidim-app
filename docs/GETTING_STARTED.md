# ðŸ‘‹ Getting started with our decidim-app

### Requirements
- **Ruby** 2.7.5
- **Bundler** 2.3.13
- **PostgreSQL** 14+
- **Node** 16.9.1
- **npm** 7.21.1
- **yarn** 1.22.19
- **Imagemagick**
- **Chrome browser and chromedriver**

### Installation

1. Clone repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics/decidim-app/
cd decidim-app
```

2. Install project dependencies

Install Ruby dependencies using `bundler` :

> bundle install

3. Setup database locally

Create the database, migrates and create seeds.

```
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

> **Warning**
> If rake command returns an error, ensure your PostgreSQL service is running : `lsof -i:5432`

4. Configure requirements from modules

**Ludens** assistant requires an extra command to be configured.
> bundle exec rake decidim_ludens:initialize

5. Installing JS dependencies

We use `yarn` to install dependencies 

> yarn install

6. **You should now be able to navigate locally !** 

You can now start your server locally by executing `bundle exec rails s` and accessing URL http://localhost:3000/  ðŸŽŠ

### Testing

Testing is very important, in the decidim-app we implement existing specs from Decidim to prevent regression. Then we update specs to match customizations made in repository. 

If you want to execute specs you can setup your test environment `bundle exec rake test:setup` then use Rspec `bundle exec rspec spec`

### Configuration
#### Machine translation configuration

Machine translation is configured through the provider [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) by using the gem https://github.com/wikiti/deepl-rb.

In order to make it work these ENV variables need to be configured:

```
TRANSLATOR_ENABLED=0
TRANSLATOR_API_KEY=*******
TRANSLATOR_HOST=https://api-free.deepl.com
```

- Obtain the `TRANSLATOR_API_KEY` by creating an account at https://www.deepl.com/pro#developer
- For `TRANSLATOR_HOST`, set it to `https://api-free.deepl.com` if using the "DeeL API Free" plan. If using the "DeepL API Pro", then set it to `https://api.deepl.com`

> Note: you still need to enable machine translation at the organization settings.
